# Social Network API

## Description

For this week's challenge it was my job to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. The API uses express, mongoDB, and the mongoose ODM. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
